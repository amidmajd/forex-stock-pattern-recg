# multi-threading
# diffrent  like ==> end-to-start pattern recognition
# diffrent percent change
# diffrent pattern corolation check
# add some weight to patterns (similarity * W) ==> W could be how old is pattern (newer better)
# Video number 13 ((Variables in pattern recognition))


# how about using each pattern range (10) as feature and percent change of this range as target 
  for Neural Network
  
  

(((((DONE))))) :
# dynamic pattern points number
# dynamic pattern future outcome looking space
# similarity threshold
# using average Value of each pattern instead of just last Value of pattern for getting percent_change from future   outcome range avg
# what of similar patterns list would be used for prediction? like ==> mean of performance of all negetives or positives (the winner of       these two) or average of all preformancess
